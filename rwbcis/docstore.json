Objective of the Scheme  \nWeather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) aims to mitigate the hardship \nof the insured farmers against the likelihood of financial loss on account of \nanticipated crop loss resulting from adverse weather conditions relating to \nrainfall, temperature, wind,  humidity etc.  WBCIS uses weather parameters as \n\u201cproxy\u201f for crop yields in compensating the cultivators for deemed crop losses. \nPayout structures are developed to the extent of losses deemed to have been \nsuffered using the weather triggers.  \n \nII.

Only adverse weather incidences which can cause substantial crop losses \nshould only be covered, or the triggers identified in such a way that major \nlosses are captured.
